# hello3000
A collection of roughly 3000 ways to say hello.

## Description

Hello 3000 is a repository containing thousands of examples of the hello world program written in various programming languages. This repository is the consequence of a dream. This repository is an exploration of languages, maybe it's art? I don't know.

I hope you enjoy it!

## Program Structure

Each "Hello World!" program follows the same pattern:
* take a user input
* assign that to the variable "name"
* print "Hello <name>!" to the output

## Contributing

If there is a language you would like to see represented that isn't currently present, consider contributing to this project by submitting a PR (Pull Request) with your language. To do that, create a PR with the title "Hello <your language>" as a single file named "hello.<your language file extension>", and that will be it! An example would be me submitting a PR titled "Hello Python" with the file "hello.py". If enough people contribute frequently enough, I will automate this process. I doubt that will happen though >_>
