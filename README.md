# hello3000
A collection of roughly 3000 ways to say hello.

## Description

Hello 3000 is a repository containing thousands of examples of the hello world program written in various programming languages. This repository is the consequence of a dream. This repository is an exploration of languages, maybe it's art? I don't know.

It's **purpose** is to be something of a reference guide to io in the vast world of programming languages. For now that goal is restricted to the universal beginner language "Hello World!", but maybe in the future some additional programs like truth machine will be included.

I hope you enjoy it!

## Program Structure

Each "Hello World!" program follows the same pattern:
* take a user input
* assign that to the variable "name"
* print "Hello [name]!" to the output

## Contributing

If there is a language you would like to see represented that isn't currently present, consider contributing to this project by submitting a PR (Pull Request) with your language.

To do that, create a PR with the title "Hello [your language]" as a single file named "hello.[your language file extension]", and that will be it! An example would be me submitting a PR titled "Hello Python" with the file "hello.py". If enough people contribute frequently enough, I will automate this process. I doubt that will happen though >_>

This is subject to the following limitations:
- contribution must be in a novel language (a language that is not already in the repository)
- contribution must follow the same formula/structure (read input, store in name, print "Hello [name]")
